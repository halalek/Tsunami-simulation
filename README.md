# Tsunami simulation using Unity

Studying the tsunami phenomenon and simulating the movement of fluid through what is known as  Particle System using Unity

## Goal : 
The primary goal of this research is to conduct an interactive simulation of the tsunami phenomenon, the results of which are logical and close to reality. It helps researchers continue their studies, in addition to the presence of an easy interactive interface that allows the user to modify a number of variables and see the result of this change.


## Causes of the tsunami phenomenon and the mechanism of its occurrence :
Earthquakes - volcanoes - landslides and other cosmic factors

## Spatial Hashing :
In order to calculate forces between particles effectively, SPH requires the use of a search algorithm to find the adjacencies to determine
The location of any particles that may affect the fundamental particle.
Finding adjacencies is a very computationally expensive process and can therefore have a somewhat negative impact
Significant time taken to process each frame.

## SPH:
It is a computational method used to simulate the mechanics of continuous media, such as solid mechanics and fluid flow.
